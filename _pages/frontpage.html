Hello, I am a Lead Image Quality Engineer at GE Healthcare based in Beijing, China. I completed my Master's Degree at the University of Michigan (Ann Arbor, MI). My interests include computed tomography(CT), computational imaging, machine learning and software engineering. I have worked in CT software team for 3 years and is currently a member of CT recon team. I am passionate about computational software and strive to create more powerful and scalable computational system in medical devices. I use the skills in both software and hardware to enhance the performance of imaging algorithms. I also enjoy archery and biking in my free time.
